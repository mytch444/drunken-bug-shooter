A fun, simple ncurses game made in c to pass time.
Move up and down the screen shooting bugs that try
to get past you. If you let three past you game over.
It nows has highscores.

To clear highscores (delete the file that is located at ~/.drunken-bug-shooter)
run
    game -c
To view them
    game -s
To play
    game

PS: the name came from githubs suggestion of drunken-octo-bear (or something similar)
